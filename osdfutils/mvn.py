    Prior information about an entity can

    'gaussian' sensors for this entity. These
    sensors produced several _samples_. Infer the
    parameters for the posterior hypothesis of the
    entity (it will be distributed according
    to a gaussian).

    _sensors_ is a dictionary of several sensors.
    Every sensor is desribed by precision (i.e.
    there is an error model for the sensors). The
    mean of these sensors is of course the entity
    in question (otherwise, get better sensors :) ).
    _samples_ is also a dictionry containing for
    every sensor in _sensors_ a set of measurements.
    The set of measurements has the usual form of
    a design matrix per sensor (i.e. rowwise observations).

    Specifically:
    - _sensors_ looks like: {"sensor1": prec_1, "sensors2": prec_2, ...}
    - _samples_ looks like: {"sensor1": obs1, "sensor2": obs2, ...}
